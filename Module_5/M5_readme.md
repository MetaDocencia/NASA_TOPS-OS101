# OS101 Module 5: Open Results

**Welcome to Open Science 101: Open Results**

## About This Module

Welcome to Open Results! This module focuses on giving you the tools you need to kick-start a scientific collaboration by creating contributor guidelines that ensure ethical contributorship. It starts out with a use case of open science in action, then a review of how to discover and assess open results. Next, the focus is on how to publish results which includes a task checklist. The module wraps up with specific guidance for writing the sharing results section of the Open Science and Data Management Plans (OSDMP). We will also reflect on how our society and technology are constantly evolving in the way we do science.

### Module Learning Objectives

After completing this module you should be able to:

- Describe what constitutes an open result.
- Explain what the reproducibility crisis is and how open science can help combat it.
- Use a process to discover, assess, and cite open results for reuse.
- List the responsibilities of the following participants that are creating open results: open results user, project leader, collaborator, contributor and author.
- List the tasks for creating reproducible results and the items to include in a manuscript to ensure reproducible results.
- Define a strategy for sharing your results including selecting publishers, interpreting journal policies and licenses, and determining when to share your data or software with your manuscript.

# Key Terms

These key terms are important topics for this module. Select the term to see the description.

**Research Object (RO)** - A method for the identification, aggregation, and exchange of scholarly information on the Web. This can include publications in different forms, software, data, and media.

**Predatory Publishing** - For-profit publishers that charge a publishing fee but provide few quality checks on the quality of the publication that would be expected from scholarly publications such as peer review or type-setting.

**Preprint** - A version of a paper prior to the publication in a journal. This can be the author’s version of the accepted manuscript after peer review or a version prior to submission to a journal.

**Preregistering** - A practice by researchers who determine their analysis plan and data collection procedure before a study begins.

**Persistent Identifiers** - Long lasting reference to a document, file, web page, or other digital object. It is usually used in the context of digital objects that are accessible over the internet. Most PIDs have a unique identifier which is linked to the current address of the metadata or content.

**Reproducibility Crisis** - The 'reproducibility crisis' in science is a growing concern over several reproducibility studies where previous positive results were not reproduced.

**DOI** - A digital object identifier is a persistent identifier's handle used to uniquely identify various objects, standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

**Code of Conduct** - A collection of rules and policies that outline the standards, principles, expectations, and morals for a particular group or organization. It is considered binding on any person who is a member of that group or organization. It can help employees align their behavior with the company’s values, support decision-making, and foster retention and loyalty.
