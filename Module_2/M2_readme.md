# OS101 Module 2: Open Tools and Resources

**Welcome to Open Science 101: Open Tools and Resources**

## About This Module

This module is designed to help you get started on your journey to practicing open science. It offers an introductory view of the concepts and resources that are fundamental to open science. The bridge between the concepts and the practice of the concepts is something called the use, make, share framework. There are many methods and models that define how to get started with open science. The use, make, share framework was constructed to help you immediately assign purpose to the concepts and tools that are covered in this module as well as in the entire Open Science 101 curriculum. All of the information that you learn here will be addressed in more detail as you participate in other modules but can also be applied immediately after completing this module.

### Module Learning Objectives

- Define the foundational elements of open science, which includes research products, the "use, make, share" framework, and the role of an Open Science and Data Management Plan.
- List and explain the purpose of resources used to discover and assess research products for reuse, including repositories, search portals, publications, documentation such as README files, metadata, and licensing.
- Develop a high-level strategy for making and sharing data that employs the FAIR principles, incorporates a data management plan, tracks data and authors with persistent identifiers and citations, and utilizes the appropriate data formats and tools for making data and sharing results.
- Describe the software lifecycle and design a high-level strategy for making and sharing software that considers the the use of a software management plan, the tools needed for development including source code, kernels, programming languages, third-party software and version control, and the tools and documentation used for publishing and curating open software.
- List the resources for sharing research products including preprints, open access publications, reference management systems, and resources to support reproducibility.

## Key Terms

These key terms are important topics for this module. Select the term to see the description.

**Virtual Machine** – A computing environment that replicates the functionality of a physical machine but at a higher level of abstraction on a computer. This allows the specified virtual machine’s resources to be more flexible and compartmentalized.

**Metadata** – Information about the data that provides additional details and context.

**Data Repository** – An enterprise data storage entity (or sometimes entities) into which data has been specifically partitioned for an analytical or reporting purpose.

**Computing Environment** – A platform that provides necessary software dependencies, a development area, and connections to computational resources to facilitate running code.

**ORCiD** – A numeric code used to uniquely identify authors and contributors of scholarly communication. Researchers provide an ORCiD for publications and association memberships. ORCiD is also an international, interdisciplinary, open, non-proprietary, and not-for-profit organization created by the research community for the benefit of all stakeholders including ours and the organizations that support the research ecosystem.

**Persistent Identifiers (PIDs)** - A long-lasting digital reference to an entity.

**Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs)** – A string of characters standardized by the International Organization for Standardization, assigned to a piece of digital content, that points to the digital location of the content.
